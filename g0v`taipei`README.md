***EASYCARD***

The public transport system runs on a reloadable contactless card called **[EasyCard](https://guidetotaipei.com/article/easycard-%E6%82%A0%E9%81%8A%E5%8D%A1)** (悠遊卡). There are also one to five day unlimited pass (for MRT and Buses), called Taipei pass, and 24hr Taipei Metro Pass (only for MRT). It’s better to buy a EasyCard unless you will plan on making 5+ trips per day then you can buy the Taipei pass at all metro station information. The EasyCard is available at all metro station information counters and convenience stores.

EasyCard credits are refundable (with some fees) so if you still have some credits left, remember to go to the MRT counter to apply for a refund.

**No eating or drinking is allowed inside the station or on the train.**

### Taxi

You can flag down a taxi from the street. Starts at NT$70-90, but in some tourist sites, the price will be a little bit higher.

### YouBike
[YouBike](http://taipei.youbike.com.tw/en/f43.php) allows commuters to rent from one station and return at another. To use YouBike, you will need an [EasyCard](https://www.easycard.com.tw/english/easycard/buy.asp) that is available at all metro station information counters and convenience stores.
